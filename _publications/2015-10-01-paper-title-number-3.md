The research in this paper focuses on the layout of aviation rescue aviation emergency resources.And it constructs a four-stage resource layout evaluation model.Based on the classification of evaluation results,fishbone diagram and expert method are used to analyze the main factors affecting the layout effect.Based on the analytic hierarchy process,the index system of layout evaluation is constructed,and the structural entropy weight method is used to complete the empowerment of indicators.In the assessment,Considering the weight of the indicators and the ambiguity of the evaluation,the HFWGHM operator is used to hierarchically integrate the indicators,and the model can simultaneously evaluate the overall effect of the resource layout and the performance of each sub-indicator.
