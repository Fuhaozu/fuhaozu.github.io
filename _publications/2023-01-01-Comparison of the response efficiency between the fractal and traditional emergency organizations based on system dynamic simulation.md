The fractal emergency organization is a new kind of organization form with plenty of advantages compared with the traditional emergency organization. A system dynamic (SD) simulation model was built to test its effectiveness in this paper. In the developed model, the emergency organization form plays the premier role in the whole response process by influencing the pattern of local control, information transmission, and decision-makers hierarchy. The comparison analysis results show that the fractal emergency organization could finish the emergency response process in a more efficient way, making the supply chain of emergency resources more agile and the resources' organization more efficient. And when the situation deteriorates, and the demand surges, the advantages of fractal emergency organizations are more significant.
