The globally located waste-to-energy (WtE) incinerators are generally of large capacities with high investments and long construction periods. This paper aims to evaluate the financial feasibility of micro WtE incinerators application in an urban environment using cost-benefit analysis (CBA). First, we propose a CBA method for such an application, considering two energy recovery methods. The advantage of carbon emission reduction over the existing disposal method is converted into monetary terms through a carbon trading system. Second, two facilities with different incineration technologies are considered. Six possible application scenarios are analyzed, taking into account differentiated benefit compositions. Third, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is carried out to measure the impact of the parameter changes. Finally, the Hong Kong International Airport is applied as a case study. The results reveal the great potential for micro WtE incinerator applications in an urban environment, and the low-temperature magnetization facility has a comparative advantage over the high-temperature pyrolysis gasification facility.
